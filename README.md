# Trend Analysis Insights Generator #

ðŸ“‹ Project Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that automates trend analysis on key business metrics like Clicks, Impressions, CTR, and Position. It calculates Week-over-Week (WoW), Month-over-Month (MoM), and Year-over-Year (YoY) changes and uses OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo to generate textual insights based on the calculated trends.

ðŸš€ Features

Calculates WoW, MoM, and YoY changes for multiple metrics.

Uses OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo to provide actionable insights.

Provides a user-friendly, interactive Jupyter Notebook for data analysis.

ðŸ“Š How It Works

The notebook reads data from an Excel sheet containing business metrics.

It calculates Week-over-Week, Month-over-Month, and Year-over-Year changes for metrics such as Clicks, Impressions, CTR, and Position.

The notebook sends a summary of these trends to OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo API to generate insights.

ðŸ§ª Example Usage

Input:

Clicks Trends:

Week-over-Week (WoW): 12.3%

Month-over-Month (MoM): -5.2%

Year-over-Year (YoY): 8.7%

AI-Generated Insights:

"The Clicks metric shows strong Week-over-Week growth of 12.3%, though Month-over-Month performance declined by 5.2%. Year-over-Year growth remains positive at 8.7%."
